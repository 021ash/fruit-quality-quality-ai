Using AI to sort fruits based on quality
# 🍋 Lemon Sorter AI System

This project uses a YOLOv8 object detection model running on a computer to detect ripe, unripe, and rotten lemons in real-time. The classification is sent to an ESP32 microcontroller, which uses a servo to divert lemons and a DC motor to run a conveyor belt.

## 📦 Features
- YOLOv8 object detection with Ultralytics
- Real-time webcam feed
- ESP32 communication via Serial
- Servo motor to sort lemons
- DC motor to drive conveyor belt
